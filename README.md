# ODModules
ODModules is a collection of WinForms controls for the .Net Versions 7 and above. It features several custom controls for use in a wide range of applications. 

## Controls
### Analog Dial Meter

### Value/Time Painters
The Time and Value Painters are a linear value indicator like the Analog Dial Meter. However, unlike the analog meter, this allows a user to paint, erase and move events within the range of values presented within the bar. The Time and Value Painters can trigger events when the value is in range.

### Numeric TextBox
The Numeric Text Box is a complete reimagined version of the stock NumericUpDown control bundled with WinForms. Unlike the NumericUpDown, this control has many improvements and features included. The NumericTextbox stores the value of what is entered as a string oppose to a double or decimal datatype. This allows the Numeric Textbox to accept extremely large and small numbers. It also features a complete SI compatible unit system, allowing it to accept SI prefixes to either end of the system (from quecto 10<sup>-30</sup> to quetta 10<sup>30</sup>). The unit system is completely optional and does not effect the current value. The control also features the ability to change the number base (does not convert) to binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. 

If the base is in decimal mode and units are enabled, the NumericTextbox allows the user to change the prefix (if in metric) using the keyboard.
